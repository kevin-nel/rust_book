// ownership https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html
/*

stack vs heap.
ownership is there to help manage heap data.

- Each value in Rust has an owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

references
- you can have *either* one mutable ref or *any number* of immutable refs
- refs must always be valid (no danglies)
